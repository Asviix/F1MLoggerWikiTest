## What is the F1Manager2024 SimHub Plugin?

F1 Manager 2024 provides limited access to detailed race data. For instance, players cannot view precise tyre wear percentages or fuel levels, and much of the available information is overly simplified or rounded. This lack of accuracy makes it difficult to plan effective race strategies.

The F1Manager2024 SimHub Plugin bridges this gap by offering players access to raw, unfiltered data, enabling more informed decision-making.

### Evolution of the Plugin

The plugin has undergone significant development. It began as a Python script that read shared memory and transmitted data to SimHub via UDP. Over time, it evolved into a robust C# plugin that directly accesses shared memory, offering improved performance and reduced CPU usage.

## Why Use This Plugin?

This plugin is designed for players who value precision and control. By providing access to accurate and detailed telemetry data, it empowers users to:

- Optimize race strategies with confidence.
- Analyze raw data for deeper insights.
- Overcome the limitations of the game's default data presentation.

## Why Does Data Accuracy Matter?

Accurate data is crucial for making informed decisions during a race. This plugin solves several key issues:

- **Hidden Information**: Gain access to critical data like tyre wear percentages and fuel levels that are otherwise unavailable.
- **Telemetry Access**: View telemetry data from other cars to better understand race dynamics.
- **Precision**: Avoid relying on heavily rounded data, which can lead to suboptimal strategies.

By using this plugin, players can unlock the full potential of F1 Manager 2024, transforming their racing experience.
